This is a nonsensical definition when considering that the basket overhangs the court, with the backboard aligned 48 inches from the baseline, then the center of the hoop being roughly 11 inches from there. This is an idiosyncracy of either sensor placement or software and data entry. Use your best judgement in making your charts, I think you will find that making some translations will be helpful. }

#' @title 
#' **Update or create a wehoop play-by-play database**
#' @description update_wbb_db() updates or creates a database with `wehoop`
#' play by play data of all completed and available games since 2002.
#'
#' @details This function creates and updates a data table with the name `tblname`
#' within a SQLite database (other drivers via `db_connection`) located in
#' `dbdir` and named `dbname`.
#' The data table combines all play by play data for every available game back
#' to the 2002 season and adds the most recent completed games as soon as they
#' are available for `wehoop`.
#'
#' The argument `force_rebuild` is of hybrid type. It can rebuild the play
#' by play data table either for the whole wehoop era (with `force_rebuild = TRUE`)
#' or just for specified seasons (e.g. `force_rebuild = c(2019, 2020)`).
#' Please note the following behavior:
#' \itemize{
#'  \item{`force_rebuild = TRUE`}{: The data table with the name `tblname`
#'   will be removed completely and rebuilt from scratch. This is helpful when
#'   new columns are added during the Off-Season.}
#'  \item{`force_rebuild = c(2019, 2020)`}{: The data table with the name `tblname`
#'  will be preserved and only rows from the 2019 and 2020 seasons will be
#'  deleted and re-added. This is intended to be used for ongoing seasons because
#'  ESPN's data provider can make changes to the underlying data during the week.}
#' }
#'
#' The parameter `db_connection` is intended for advanced users who want
#' to use other DBI drivers, such as MariaDB, Postgres or odbc. Please note that
#' the arguments `dbdir` and `dbname` are dropped in case a `db_connection`
#' is provided but the argument `tblname` will still be used to write the
#' data table into the database.
#'
#' @param dbdir Directory in which the database is or shall be located
#' @param dbname File name of an existing or desired SQLite database within `dbdir`
#' @param tblname The name of the play by play data table within the database
#' @param force_rebuild Hybrid parameter (logical or numeric) to rebuild parts
