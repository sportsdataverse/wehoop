# **Load wehoop WNBA Stats Standings**

Loads season-level WNBA standings scraped from the WNBA Stats API
(`leaguestandingsv3`-style outputs). One row per team-season. Backed by
the `wehoop-wnba-stats-data` pipeline that reads raw JSONs from
`wehoop-wnba-stats-raw` and publishes parquet/rds artifacts to the
`wnba_stats_standings` release tag.

`load_wnba_stats_standings_manifest()` returns the per-season manifest
CSV (`season`, `row_count`, `generated_at_utc`, `source_endpoint`) for
the WNBA Stats standings release tag without downloading any season's
full data.

## Usage

``` r
load_wnba_stats_standings(
  seasons = most_recent_wnba_stats_season(),
  ...,
  dbConnection = NULL,
  tablename = NULL
)

load_wnba_stats_standings_manifest()
```

## Arguments

- seasons:

  A vector of 4-digit years associated with given WNBA seasons. (Min:
  1997)

- ...:

  Additional arguments passed to an underlying function that writes the
  season data into a database.

- dbConnection:

  A `DBIConnection` object, as returned by
  [`DBI::dbConnect()`](https://dbi.r-dbi.org/reference/dbConnect.html)

- tablename:

  The name of the standings data table within the database

## Value

Returns a `wehoop_data` tibble of team standings.
