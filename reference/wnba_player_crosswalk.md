# **Get the WNBA cross-source player crosswalk**

Build a wide, one-row-per-player-per-team crosswalk linking ESPN, WNBA
Stats, and Fox player identities for a season. Matching is
deterministic: normalized exact name within a team block, then
Jaro-Winkler fuzzy with jersey/DOB tiebreakers. Yahoo columns are NA
placeholders.

## Usage

``` r
wnba_player_crosswalk(
  season = most_recent_wnba_season(),
  min_confidence = 0.92
)
```

## Arguments

- season:

  Season year (numeric). Defaults to the most recent WNBA season.

- min_confidence:

  Jaro-Winkler similarity floor for fuzzy matches (default 0.92).

## Value

A `wehoop_data` tibble, one row per player per team (ESPN-anchored).
