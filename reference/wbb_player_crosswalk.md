# **Get the WBB cross-source player crosswalk**

Build a wide, one-row-per-player-per-team crosswalk linking ESPN and Fox
Sports (Bifrost) WBB player identities for a season. ESPN is the anchor
source; Fox is matched by normalized name (exact first, then
Jaro-Winkler fuzzy with jersey tiebreaker) within each team block. Yahoo
columns are NA placeholders. Torvik and the WNBA Stats API have no
per-player tables for WBB, so neither source is joined.

## Usage

``` r
wbb_player_crosswalk(season = most_recent_wbb_season(), min_confidence = 0.92)
```

## Arguments

- season:

  Season year (4-digit, e.g. `2025`). Defaults to
  [`most_recent_wbb_season()`](https://wehoop.sportsdataverse.org/reference/most_recent_wbb_season.md).

- min_confidence:

  Jaro-Winkler similarity floor for fuzzy matches (default 0.92).

## Value

A `wehoop_data` tibble, one row per player per team (ESPN-anchored):

|  |  |  |
|----|----|----|
| col_name | types | description |
| season | integer | Season year. |
| espn_team_id | integer | ESPN team id (canonical key). |
| team_abbreviation | character | ESPN team abbreviation. |
| player_name | character | Normalized player name (matching key). |

| fox_position_group | character | Fox position group label (NA if unmatched). |
| yahoo_player_id | character | Yahoo player id (NA placeholder). |
| yahoo_player_name | character | Yahoo player name (NA placeholder). |
| match_method | character | "exact_name"/"fuzzy_jw"/"unmatched". |

| match_keys | character | NA (reserved for future use). |
