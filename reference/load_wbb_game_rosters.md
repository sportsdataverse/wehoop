# **Load wehoop WBB Game Rosters**

`load_wbb_game_rosters_manifest()` returns the per-season manifest CSV
(`season`, `row_count`, `generated_at_utc`, `source_endpoint`) for the
game rosters release tag without downloading any season's full data.

Loads per-game rosters scraped from ESPN women's college basketball box
scores. One row per athlete-team-game triple, with athlete identifiers,
jersey, position, starter flag, and DNP status. Backed by the
`wehoop-wbb-data` pipeline that reads raw JSONs from `wehoop-wbb-raw`
and publishes parquet/rds artifacts to the
`espn_womens_college_basketball_game_rosters` release tag.

## Usage

``` r
load_wbb_game_rosters_manifest()

load_wbb_game_rosters(
  seasons = most_recent_wbb_season(),
  ...,
  dbConnection = NULL,
  tablename = NULL
)
```

## Arguments

- seasons:

  A vector of 4-digit years associated with given women's college
  basketball seasons. (Min: 2002)

- ...:

  season data into a database.

- dbConnection:

  A `DBIConnection` object, as returned by
  [`DBI::dbConnect()`](https://dbi.r-dbi.org/reference/dbConnect.html)

- tablename:

  The name of the game rosters data table within the database
