# **Load wehoop WBB Officials**

`load_wbb_officials_manifest()` returns the per-season manifest CSV
(`season`, `row_count`, `generated_at_utc`, `source_endpoint`) for the
officials release tag without downloading any season's full data.

Loads game-level officials data scraped from ESPN women's college
basketball summary feeds. One row per official-game pair. Backed by the
`wehoop-wbb-data` pipeline that reads raw JSONs from `wehoop-wbb-raw`
and publishes parquet/rds artifacts to the
`espn_womens_college_basketball_officials` release tag.

## Usage

``` r
load_wbb_officials_manifest()

load_wbb_officials(
  seasons = most_recent_wbb_season(),
  ...,
  dbConnection = NULL,
  tablename = NULL
)
```

## Arguments

- seasons:

  A vector of 4-digit years associated with given women's college
  basketball seasons. (Min: 2002)

- ...:

  Additional arguments passed to an underlying function that writes the
  season data into a database.

- dbConnection:

  A `DBIConnection` object, as returned by
  [`DBI::dbConnect()`](https://dbi.r-dbi.org/reference/dbConnect.html)

- tablename:

  The name of the officials data table within the database
