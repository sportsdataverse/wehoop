# **Get ESPN WNBA Season Ranking Detail**

Returns the per-week snapshot index for one ranking source (e.g. AP Top
25). Each row is one weekly snapshot; the `ref` URL resolves to the
actual ranked teams for that (season-type x week) and will be wrapped by
a forthcoming `espn_LOWERWNBA_week_ranking()`.

## Usage

``` r
espn_wnba_season_ranking(ranking_id, season = most_recent_wnba_season(), ...)
```

## Arguments

- ranking_id:

  ESPN ranking identifier (character or numeric).

- season:

  Season year. Defaults to most recent WNBA season.

- ...:

  Additional arguments; currently unused.

## Value

A tibble with one row per weekly snapshot.
